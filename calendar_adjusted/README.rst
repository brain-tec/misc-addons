========================
 Adjusted Calendar View
========================

* Makes short events (less than 30 minutes) readable. It's done by backporting
  parameter `timeGridEventMinHeight
  <https://fullcalendar.io/docs/v4/timeGridEventMinHeight>`__ to fullcalendar v3
  and activating it in Odoo.
